# Contributing

Anyone at MLSDev is welcomed _(and expected)_ to initiate improvements, changes or updates to company's Development Standards.

There are just a few simple rules:

1. Minor updates and changes (like Ruby version update) may be done via _pull request_ to this repo.
1. Major changes to the workflow (like migration of the whole Backend Department from Ruby to Elixir) must be discussed and approved within the Team (e.g. during Department Meeting).
1. A person who makes changes to this repo must notify everyone whom it may concern (Department, Managers, the whole Team etc) **in writing** via Slack message or e-mail (latter preferred).

**Important note**. While the change you initiated is in the process of approval, you must follow these Development Standards until the change is in place.
